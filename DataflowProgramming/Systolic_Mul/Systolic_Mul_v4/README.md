# Systolic Array Development - Completing the Design

In this version, we are focusing on completing the design with critical fixes and optimizations.

---

## Upgrade Overview

### Enhancements
- **Timer Fix**: Fixed the timer to ensure accurate performance measurements.
- **East Halo Addition**: Added the east artificial halo to stream D2H (device-to-host) results back to the host.
- **Kernel Optimization**: Applied several optimizations to the kernel code to improve overall performance.

---

## Next Steps
- Validate the accuracy of the fixed timer and confirm precise performance metrics.
- Test the D2H streaming with the new east halo to ensure proper data transfer back to the host.
- Further evaluate kernel optimizations for potential areas of improvement.
