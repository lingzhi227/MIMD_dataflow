Cannon's Algorithm:
Cannon's algorithm is indeed one of the most well-known algorithms for matrix multiplication on 2D processor grids. It's designed to minimize communication overhead and maximize parallel efficiency.
Key features:

Initial alignment of matrices A and B
Systolic communication pattern
Each processor performs local matrix multiplication and shifts data


Fox's Algorithm:
Similar to Cannon's algorithm but with a different communication pattern.
Key features:

Broadcast of matrix A elements along rows
Shifting of matrix B elements along columns
Suitable for heterogeneous systems


SUMMA (Scalable Universal Matrix Multiplication Algorithm):
A more flexible algorithm that can work with rectangular processor grids.
Key features:

Uses broadcast operations instead of point-to-point communication
Can be more efficient on systems with good broadcast support


Strassen-Winograd Algorithm:
An adaptation of Strassen's algorithm for distributed systems.
Key features:

Reduces the number of multiplications at the cost of more additions
Can be more efficient for very large matrices


3D Algorithms:
Extensions of 2D algorithms to use a 3D processor grid.
Key features:

Can reduce communication volume for very large processor counts
Examples include 3D-Cannon and 2.5D algorithms
